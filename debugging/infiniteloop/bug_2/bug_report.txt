=== Expected behaviour ===

This program randomly chooses a number from 0 to 10 which the user has to guess.

The goal is for the user to find the number as quickly as possible.

When the user finds the number, its score is printed.

=== Bug ===

Even when trying all valid input, the game continues without accepting the user's answer.
