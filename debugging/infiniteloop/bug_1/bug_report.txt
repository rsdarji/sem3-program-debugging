=== Expected behaviour ===
This simple app should prompt the user for a list of words.
There is no restriction on the words, they can contain special characters.
The user is the asked to input some letters.
The app should output all words which do not contain those letters.
The app is not case sensitive.

=== Bug ===
You previously helped fixing a bug with this program.
This is a new version of the 'filter_name.py' script from a previous problem set.

The previous bug was caused by updating the list of words inside a for-loop.
For this reason, we decided to rewrite the algorithms used in this app.

Although, since the update the program seems to freeze instead of outputting.
