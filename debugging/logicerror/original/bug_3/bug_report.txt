=== Expected behaviour ===
This program is a prototype to create a card game.
At the start of the game, ths player will be asked to pick five different cards.
The program then prints the player's hand and the game can start.
For now, the rest of the game is not implemented.

=== Bug ===
Some cards which should be in the deck cannot be picked correctly.
The program will sometimes print "This choice is not available" even though the card is listed as available.
