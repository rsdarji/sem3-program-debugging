=== Expected Behaviour ===
This app is used by retail workers to quickly write a shop's inventory to a file and sort it.
The app first prompt the user to enter items one at a time by entering their name and quantity available
The user is then asked to choose whether the file should be sorted by item name or by item quantity.

By example, if the user answers the following:

  Enter an item name: shoes
  Enter the item quantity: 5
  Continue? [y/n]: y
  Enter an item name: jackets
  Enter the item quantity: 2
  Continue? [y/n]: y
  Enter an item name: hats
  Enter the item quantity: 11
  Continue? [y/n]: n
  Do you want to sort the inventory by quantity or name? [qty/name]: qty

The output in "inventory.txt" should look like this.

  Jackets: 2
  Shoes: 5
  Hats: 11

=== Bug ===
Sometimes when sorting by quantity, the output in "inventory.txt" is not ordered correctly.

By example with the same output as above, we have the following file.

  Hats: 11
  Jackets: 2
  Shoes: 5
