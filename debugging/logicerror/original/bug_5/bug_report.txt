=== Expected behaviour ===
A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.
Every number can be written as a product of prime factors.

Examples:
    12 = 2 * 2 * 3
    45 = 3 * 3 * 5
    100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5

This app prompts the user for a number and prints out its prime factorization.

It should look like this:

    Enter a number to find its prime factorization: 75
    The factors of 75 are: 1, 3, 5, 5

=== Bug ===
The output is missing prime factors most of the time.

Here is an example with the above input:

    Enter a number to find its prime factorization: 75
    The factors of 75 are: 1, 5, 5

This is clearly incorrect since 5 * 5 = 25. The factor '3' is missing.

This leads us to think our algorithm must be incorrect
