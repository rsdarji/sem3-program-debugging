A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label.
The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth.
A written symbol like "5" that represents a number is called a numeral.
A numeral system is an organized way to write and manipulate this type of symbol,
for example the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system allows combinations of numerical digits
like "5" and "0" to represent larger numbers like 50.
Numbers can also be negative, by example -1.
